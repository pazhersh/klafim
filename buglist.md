# known bugs
## big
* hover forces are all wrong
## small
* hover doesn't come directly to the mouse - need to hover to intersection with plane above the ground, instead of intersection with the ground and adding z translation
* cards do not flip over their y axis when drawn, they just reset to 0

# missing planned features
* xcel uploader
* about page
* non shitty look
* color changing card
