# known bugs
* the bottom card is not straight with the ground
* the dynamic texture loader mirrors the image (including written text)
* hover forces are all wrong
* hover doesn't come directly to the mouse - need to hover to intersection with plane above the ground, instead of intersection with the ground and adding z translation
* there's a random wait when drawing a card (between flipping the card and releasing it)

# missing planned features
* xcel uploader
* about page
