# known bugs
## big
* physics feel bad
## small
* cards do not flip over their y axis when drawn, they just reset to 0
* use damping to slow down cards on drag
* no limit to pan/rotate view
* when card gets flipped by physics, it doesn't unflip when picking up

# missing planned features
* xcel uploader
* about page
* non shitty look
* color changing card
